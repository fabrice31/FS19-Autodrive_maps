# Farming Simulator 19 - Autrodrive - Maps configurations

## Autodrive mod

Autodrive is a useful mod for Farming Simulator 19. In the game, you drive vehicles to work in your farm. The interessant part is not to drive, but to use them. The autodrive allow you to send your tractor here you want, and you can focus on field work.

You can find more detail on the [official page](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=fr&country=ca&mod_id=127335&title=fs2019).


## Why this repo

The mod is very useful (in single player, I could say essential), but you need to take a lots of time to configure all the roads, usefuls points in the map. One for each field, each shop, etc... It is time consuming. I had already done this for several maps, and here are the configuration files.


## How to use

Create your game with the mod "Autrodrive" set ON. Save the party and quit the game.
Copy the file from the repo into your folder. Launch your game, that's it.

Use only the file for the map you use in your game. If you don't, roads won't match and your vehicles will go through walls or rivers. And you don't want that.


## Known problems

* If you use a file for the wrong map, roads will be wrong.
* If you use a file for the wrong map version, some point / roads could be wrong.
* Some of the points got the french name instead of the english one : tell me, I'll fix that.
* Some points / roads are missing on a map : tell me, I'll fix that.
